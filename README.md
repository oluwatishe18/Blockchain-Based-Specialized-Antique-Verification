# Blockchain-Based Specialized Antique Verification

A decentralized platform for authenticating, tracking, and verifying antique objects using blockchain technology.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent record of antique items throughout their lifecycle. By digitizing authentication, ownership history, and restoration records, we provide a trusted verification system for collectors, museums, auction houses, and insurance companies.

## Core Components

### Item Registration Contract

Records essential details about antique objects including:
- Unique identifier
- Physical descriptions and measurements
- Historical context and estimated date of creation
- Materials and construction techniques
- Photographs and condition assessment
- Initial valuation
- Current ownership details

### Expert Authentication Contract

Validates and records professional assessments:
- Registered appraiser credentials and reputation scores
- Authentication methodologies used
- Scientific testing results (carbon dating, material analysis, etc.)
- Digital signatures confirming expert assessment
- Secondary opinion records
- Authentication confidence level

### Ownership History Contract

Maintains a comprehensive provenance record:
- Complete chain of ownership
- Transaction details and timestamps
- Supporting documentation for each transfer
- Exhibition history
- Past auction records
- Cultural/historical significance documentation
- Geographic movement tracking

### Restoration Tracking Contract

Documents all conservation and restoration activities:
- Restoration professionals' credentials
- Pre and post-restoration condition reports
- Materials and techniques used
- Restoration rationale and approach
- Before/after imagery
- Reversibility of interventions
- Impact assessment on item value

## Getting Started
